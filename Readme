TicTacToe

Its an application where users can play TicTacToe. They can
register accounts and login to see other players and their
total wins. Everyone can play against CPU.

I use entity framework to communicate with the DB and JWT
tokens to authenticate a loggen in user. When the API starts
execution seeds data from SeedData.json.
